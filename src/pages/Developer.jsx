            <p className="banner-description">
              Dynamic and results-driven Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years
              in full-stack development across high-impact, large-scale
              applications. I bring expertise in Ruby on Rails, React, Node,
              AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker, with a passion for optimizing systems
              to scale. I’ve led initiatives serving 10,000+ users and managing
              50 million+ bookings, driving feature-rich integrations like chat,
              video consultations, and API linkups.
              <br />A recent achievement was implementing robust security
              measures across four NHSPS products, including XSS script
              validation in both frontend and backend, advanced password
              policies with the Devise gem, and stringent password resets every
              six months. Additionally, I transformed a legacy reporting engine
              into a high-speed microservices architecture, reducing report
              generation from 5 minutes to 5 seconds and delivering real-time
              insights for users.
