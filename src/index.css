/* 
This is a custom animation for the Netflix-like loader effect
It creates a pop-in effect with a glowing text shadow
The text will scale up and have a glowing effect similar to the Netflix logo animation
The animation lasts for 1.5 seconds and eases out at the end
The text color is set to Netflix red (#e50914) with a glowing effect
The animation starts with the text scaled down and invisible, then scales up and becomes visible with a glowing effect
The final state has the text at its normal size with a strong glow
The animation can be applied to any element by adding the class 'animate-popIn'
